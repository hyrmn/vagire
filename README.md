This is a TCP-based echo client. I made it to make sure it could work with [gecho](https://github.com/hyrmn/gecho), my Go-based TCP echo server and [necho](https://github.com/hyrmn/necho), my .NET Core TCP echo server. Those servers work with Putty as well of course. Because, you know, I need to keep myself honest.
